# Cpp-Neural-Network
A from-scratch implementation of a simple neural network in C++ using MSE loss and stochastic gradient descent.
<br>
<br>
Everything is contained within a single C++ file which contains heavily commented code explaining how the network code is formulated.
<br>
<br>
To compile and run in Windows,
```ruby
g++ Network.cpp
.\a
```
Project roadmap
- [x] Neuron/Network Class
- [x] Backpropagation
- [x] Data class
- [ ] Custom loss function
- [ ] Custom optimisers
